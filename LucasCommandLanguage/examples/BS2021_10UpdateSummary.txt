Super:
Creates clone of self that does exactly what Lola does, including movement and attacking.
When Lola attacks, clone attacks in the same direction as Lola's aiming.
/div chp1 [hp1] 2
/div chp9 [hp9] 2
Clone has same damage as Lola but only half health ({chp1} at level 1, {chp9} at level 9)
If you run clone into wall, can use that to reposition the clone.

1st Star Power:
/store dpp10 509 Number
/div increaseFactor [dpp10] [dpp9]
/sub increaseFactor [increaseFactor] 1
/times increaseFactor [increaseFactor] 100
When Lola has only 1 ammo remaining, the ammo bar turns yellow, and Lola's damage per projectile (max level) increases from {dpp9} to {dpp10}.
That is a {increaseFactor}% increase!
Note that Lola's clone does NOT receive boosts from this star power.
