So far, I believe that my progress in this program has been quite good.
I still need to implement a bunch of stuff like arithmetic, control flow, and user inputs, but look at what I have accomplished today:
/line
- Variables
- Basic Structure
- Digits and Line Functions
- and a lot more :D
/line
I am very happy with the result, and as I say so, I will sign off for the day...

/store n1 Royal String
/store n2 Cannon String
/store signatureNumber 2630 Number

/line
------ {n1} {n2} {signatureNumber} :D
/line
